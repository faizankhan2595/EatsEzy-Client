        <div>
          When we make our platform available to you for use, we process
          personal data from various sources. On the one hand, this is data that
          we automatically collect when you use the platform. However, this may
          also include data which you have voluntarily provided to us or which
          we receive from our partners.

          As soon as you visit the website or open the app, you send technical
          information to our web servers. This happens regardless of whether you
          make a reservation at a restaurant or whether you log in later using
          an account with us to use the platform. In each case we collect the
          following access data and web access data (which we refer to

          We process access data so that you and other users can use the

          continuously improve the platform and correct errors to ensure IT
          security and the operation of our systems and to prevent or detect
          misuse, particularly fraud.

        <div>
          In addition, we process to access data to adapt the platform to your
          needs (personalization). To this end, we also assign you what is known
          as a "<span className="highlight">Unique User ID</span>". With this
          unique user ID, we can associate your bookings and other interactions.

            Data that you transmit to us yourself
          </div>
          In addition to the data we receive from all visitors, we also process
          other data. The exact volume of such data depends on how you use the
          platform. You can use the platform with or without creating a user
          account.
          <div className="highlight my-3"> Account data</div>
          If you decide to create a user account and complete the registration
          form, we will process the following information:
          <ul className="highlight flex flex-col gap-y-1 mt-2 pl-4">
            <li>* Name and surname </li>
            <li>* E-mail address </li>

          </ul>
          <div className="highlight my-3"> Booking and reservation data</div>
          When you book or reserve, we also process your:

            <li>* Name and surname </li>
            <li>* E-mail address </li>

          </ul>
          Please do not enter any sensitive personal information in the field "
          <span className="highlight">special preferences</span>". We process
          such data in order to be able to handle your reservation, inform you
          about the status of your reservation, and customise the platform based
          on your previous reservations and bookings.
          <div className="highlight my-3">Evaluations and reviews</div>
          The platform offers you the possibility to use certain social
          functions: You can leave ratings and reviews for restaurants. You can
          also subscribe to comments and reviews from other users. When you use
          these features, your IP address will be stored when you post a comment
          or rating. This is a protective measure for us in case someone
          publishes illegal content, comments and/or contributions (insults,
          forbidden political propaganda, etc.). In such cases, we must be able
          to determine the identity of the author, as legal action can be taken
          based on the content in the comments or posts.
          <br />
          If you would like to subscribe to the following comments, a
          confirmation email will be sent to confirm that you are actually the
          owner of the email address you entered. Subscriptions for comments can
          be deleted at any time. The confirmation e-mail contains the
          corresponding instructions.
          <div className="highlight my-3"> Loyalty points</div>
          You receive Loyalty Points for each successful reservation. In order
          to manage these Loyalty Points, we process your reservation data and
          booking history. When redeeming your Loyalty Points, we additionally
          ask you to provide us with your bank details in order to initiate the
          payout. After the bank transfer is complete, we delete your bank
          details.
          <div className="highlight my-3">Payment details</div>
          We do not process any sensitive details about card payments ourselves,
          but use secure payment providers who do this for us. The payment data
          you enter is encrypted in your browser by the payment provider in a
          way that only the payment provider can access, while we only receive
          non-sensitive data (payment method) and references that confirm that
          you have made a payment. We do not store any other payment information
          in our system.

            Newsletters and promotional e-mails
          </div>
          If you wish to receive our newsletter, we need your consent for this.
          We use the so-called double opt-in process for our newsletter, so that
          you are only subscribed to the newsletter once you click on the link
          in the confirmation email. This way we can make sure that you are the
          rightful owner of the email address. The newsletter contains
          information about Capitol Tech, restaurants and current offers. Legal
          basis for the sending of newsletters is your consent.
          <br />
          When subscribing to the newsletter, we collect your IP address, the
          date and the exact time of your subscription. This data is stored in
          order to prove that you signed up to the newsletter. Also, we need the
          data in case your email address was fraudulently used
          <br />
          Furthermore, when interacting with the newsletter, we collect device
          and usage data. For example, we record if the newsletter was
          delivered, if you opened the newsletter or if you clicked on a link in
          the newsletter. We link your email address to this data in order to
          personalise and statistically analyse the newsletter. If you use our
          app, we will also connect the data collected within the app with this
          usage data from the newsletter. This way we make sure that we display
          offers within the app that are relevant to you.
          <br />
          You can withdraw your consent to receive newsletters with any form of
          personalisation at any time without incurring any costs other than the
          transmission costs in accordance with the basic tariffs. Just click on
          the unsubscribe link at the end of each newsletter or send an email to
          the address set out above.
          <div className="highlight my-3"> Customer support requests</div>
          Perhaps you would like to ask our customer service for assistance or
          make a complaint. In this case, we will process your IP address and

          respond to your request.

            Data we receive from partners and third-party platforms
          </div>
          Since our platform serves as an intermediary between you and the
          restaurant where you make your reservation, we also process data that
          we receive from our partner restaurants. Similarly, we may receive
          information from third party platforms where a reservation made by you
          on that third party platform is made by Capitol Tech. The data in
          question comprises:

          We maintain what is referred to as a fan page on the Facebook

          market research and advertising purposes, which are stored in user
          profiles using pseudonyms. Cookies are set for this purpose. Based on
          these cookies, we can carry out statistical evaluations, for instance.
          This serves our legitimate interest on an optimised presentation (for
          further information on the legal foundations, see below). Data
          processing is carried out on the basis of an agreement between jointly

            <li>

        </div>
        <div className="highlight-lg">
          4. What is the legal basis of data processing?
        </div>
        <div>
          When processing your personal data, we rely on local data protection
          law and use your personal data only for the fulfilment of our
          services.
          <br />
          In this context, we refer in detail to the following legal
          foundations:
          <div className="highlight my-3">Consent</div>
          Since you have given us your consent to process personal data for the
          above-mentioned purposes, such consent guarantees the lawfulness of
          such processing. By registering with your account information or
          making a reservation, you expressly consent to the processing of your
          data as described in this Privacy Policy by crossing the box before
          submitting the registration or reservation form: When we process your
          data, this is because you have expressly permitted and requested us to
          do so when you use our platform. Your consent thus represents the most
          important legal basis for the processing of your personal data by us.
          <div className="highlight my-3">
            Fulfilment of our contractual obligations towards you
          </div>
          At the same time, the processing serves to make the platform available
          within the scope of performance under our contract with you.
          Accordingly, in most cases the processing is justified not only with
          your consent, but also because it is necessary to fulfil our contract
          with you. For example, if you make a reservation at a restaurant via
          our platform, we need to process the reservation data to secure your
          reservation.
          <div className="highlight my-3">Our legitimate interests</div>
          There are also cases in which we would be entitled to process your
          data without your consent if this is necessary to protect our
          legitimate interests (or those of third parties). In this respect, the
          purposes described above, for which we process your data, in many
          cases also represent legitimate interests. This means that we may
          process the data necessary to ensure the security of our IT systems in
          any case, even if you have not given or withdrawn your consent to such
          processing. This also refers to the prevention of abuse of our
          platform or the personalisation of advertising for your interests
          (referred to as direct marketing).
          <div className="highlight my-3">Statutory requirements</div>
          In addition, we are required by law to provide certain information to
          the law enforcement or tax authorities upon request in inpidual cases.
        </div>
        <div className="highlight-lg">5. To whom do we transmit your data?</div>
        <div>
          We treat your personal data with care and confidentiality and pass
          such data on to third parties only to the extent described below and
          no further. We only transmit data to public authorities if there is a
          legal obligation to do so as a result of a request for information
          from the competent authority.
          <br />
          Beyond statutory obligations to public authorities, we will only share
          your information with other users of the platform, with our
          third-party providers who assist us in providing the platform, or
          within the Capitol Tech Group of Companies.
          <div className="highlight my-3">Other users of the platform</div>
          We transfer the booking and reservation data via the platform to our
          partner restaurants to enable reservations to be made at their
          restaurants. We also share your loyalty points with the restaurants to
          ensure the smooth running of these programs. Restaurants will receive
          your account information (except your password) and any ratings or
          reviews you enter into the platform's system. Ratings and reviews will
          also be published on the platform so that they can be seen by all
          remaining users (including visitors without an account on the
          platform).
          <div className="highlight my-3">Other third parties</div>
          In addition, we transmit data to external service providers who enable
          us to provide the platform. This includes the data and providers
          listed in our cookie policy. Please note in this connection that all
          of our server hosting and cloud services are made available by Amazon
          Web Services, Inc. (" AWS") as well as Google Ireland Limited. Both
          providers process all data on our behalf and we have subjected them to
          a strict data processing agreement to ensure the security of the
          processing.
        </div>
        <div className="highlight-lg">6. How long will my data be stored?</div>
        <div>
          We process and store your personal data as long as this is necessary
          for compliance with our contractual or statutory obligations. We
          therefore store the data as long as our contractual relationship with
          you exists and after termination only to the extent that and as long
          as the applicable laws require. All other data will be deleted
          immediately when you log out of the platform. If the remaining data is
          no longer required for fulfilment of such obligations, then the data
          in question will be deleted regularly unless further processing
          thereof is necessary for the preservation of evidence or for legal
          claims subject to the statute of limitations.

          7. Does Capitol Tech create a user profile with my personal data?
        </div>
        <div>
          We use your data to optimise your Capitol Tech browser experience.
          This means that we use your data to provide you with a personalised
          platform based on your personal preferences and interests and to
          create customised offers based on your previous behaviour patterns.
          For example, the IP address of your computer is used to identify your
          geographic location and provide you with localised content in your
          language. We can make suggestions and offers for new restaurants based

          <div className="mb-3 highlight">Google Analytics</div>
          Our platform uses the web analysis service Google Analytics, from
          Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California 94043,
          USA, for the purpose of analysing and continuously optimising our
          website.
          <br />
          Google Analytics uses cookies which allow website use to be analysed
          (e.g. sites surfed by you, conversions, your interactions with our
          webpages, technical information of your browser, shortened
          IP-address). Pseudonymised user profiles are created for this purpose.
          We use Google Analytics only with activated IP anonymisation.
          Furthermore, we use the User-ID function. This function allows us to
          assign sessions and all activities during those sessions to a
          permanent User ID. It is therefore possible to analyse user behaviour
          across different devices.
          <br />
          You can prevent cookies from being stored by configuring the operating
          system settings on your browser or mobile device or within our cookie
          consent management tool accordingly. However, please bear in mind
          that, in this case, you may not be able to make full use all of the
          functions on our platform. You can also prevent the data produced by

          Google Marketing Platform enables its users to place ads on their
          websites. Advertisers can determine how often, when, and for how long
          ads are displayed in a browser, and use cookies to facilitate
          behavioural targeting by indi-cating which areas of a website you are
          browsing. A pseudonymised identification number is assigned to your
          browser in order to check which advertisements are displayed in your
          browser and which have been accessed. The cookies do not contain any
          personal data. You can deactivate the use of cookies by Google for
          such purposes at https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated. Both

          We cooperate with Facebook Inc., 1601 South California Avenue, Palo
          Alto, California 94304, USA, in order to address users again on
          Facebook. For this purpose, we have integrated Facebook Pixel into our
          websites. When you visit websites with one of these integrated pixels,
          non-personal data is automatically transmitted to Facebook for
          analysing and marketing purposes, which is assigned a user ID by
          Facebook. As soon as you register with Facebook, Facebook assigns the
          transmitted data to your Facebook profile and assigns you to certain
          groups based on your surfing behaviour (so-called custom audiences).
